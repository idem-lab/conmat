\title{Aggregate predicted contacts to specified age breaks}
\usage{
aggregate_predicted_contacts(
  predicted_contacts_1y,
  population,
  age_breaks = c(seq(0, 75, by = 5), Inf)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted_contacts_1y}{contacts in 1 year breaks (could technically
by in other year breaks). Data must contain columns, \code{age_from}, \code{age_to},
\code{contacts}, and \code{se_contacts}, which is the same output as
\code{\link[=predict_contacts_1y]{predict_contacts_1y()}} - see examples below.}

\item{population}{a \code{conmat_population} object, which has the \code{age} and
\code{population} columns specified, or a dataframe with columns
\code{lower.age.limit}, and \code{population}. See examples below.}

\item{age_breaks}{vector of ages. Default: c(seq(0, 75, by = 5), Inf)}
}
\value{
data frame with columns, \code{age_group_from}, \code{age_group_to}, and
\code{contacts}, which is the aggregated model.
}
\description{
Aggregates contacts rate from, say, a 1 year level into
provided age  breaks, weighting the contact rate by the specified age
population. For example, if you specify breaks as c(0, 5, 10, 15, Inf),
it will return age groups as 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15+ (Inf). Used
internally within \code{\link[=predict_contacts]{predict_contacts()}}, although can be used by users.
}
\examples{
fairfield <- abs_age_lga("Fairfield (C)")

fairfield

# We can predict the contact rate for Fairfield from the existing contact
# data, say, between the age groups of 0-15 in 5 year bins for school:

fairfield_contacts_1 <- predict_contacts_1y(
  model = polymod_setting_models$home,
  population = fairfield,
  age_min = 0,
  age_max = 15
)

fairfield_contacts_1

aggregated_fairfield <- aggregate_predicted_contacts(
  predicted_contacts_1y = fairfield_contacts_1,
  population = fairfield,
  age_breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, Inf)
)
