\title{Apply vaccination effects to next generation contact matrices}
\usage{
apply_vaccination(ngm, data, coverage_col, acquisition_col, transmission_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{ngm}{next generation matrices. See \code{\link[=generate_ngm]{generate_ngm()}} for creating next
generation matrices of a state or a local government area for specific age
groups}

\item{data}{data frame with location specific information on vaccine
coverage, efficacy of acquisition/susceptibility and efficacy of
transmission/infectiousness for the ordered age groups from lowest to
highest of the next generation matrix}

\item{coverage_col}{bare variable name for the column with information on
vaccine coverage by age groups}

\item{acquisition_col}{bare variable name for the column with information
on efficacy of acquisition}

\item{transmission_col}{bare variable name for the column with information
on efficacy of transmission}
}
\value{
list of contact matrices, one for each setting with reduction in
transmission matching the next generation matrices
}
\description{
Applies the effect of vaccination on the next generation of
infections, to understand and describe the reduction of acquisition and
transmission in each age group.
}
\details{
Vaccination improves a person's immunity from a disease. When a
sizeable section of the population receives vaccinations or when vaccine
coverage is sufficient enough, the likelihood that the unvaccinated
population will contract the disease is decreased. This helps to slow
infectious disease spread as well as lessen its severity. For this reason,
it is important to understand how much of a reduction in probability of
acquisition (the likelihood that an individual will contract the disease),
and probability of transmission (the likelihood that an individual will
spread the disease after contracting it), has occurred as an the effect of
vaccination, in other words the effect of vaccination on the next
generation of infections.

\code{apply_vaccination} returns the percentage reduction in acquisition and
transmission in each age group. It does this by taking the outer product
of these reductions in acquisition and transmission by age group, creating
a transmission reduction matrix. The next generation matrices with the
vaccination effects applied are then produced using the obtained
transmission reduction matrix and the next generation matrices passed to
the function as an argument.
