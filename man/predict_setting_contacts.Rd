\usage{
predict_setting_contacts(
  population,
  contact_model,
  age_breaks,
  per_capita_household_size = NULL,
  model_per_capita_household_size = get_polymod_per_capita_household_size()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{population}

\item{contact_model}{contact_model}

\item{age_breaks}{age_breaks}

\item{per_capita_household_size}{Optional (defaults to NULL). When set, it
adjusts the household contact matrix by some per capita household size.
To set it, provide a single number, the per capita household size. More
information is provided below in Details. See
\code{\link[=get_abs_per_capita_household_size]{get_abs_per_capita_household_size()}} function for a helper for Australian
data with a workflow on how to get this number.}

\item{model_per_capita_household_size}{modelled per capita household size.
Default values for this are from
\code{\link[=get_polymod_per_capita_household_size]{get_polymod_per_capita_household_size()}}, which ends up being 3.248971}

List of setting matrices

\description{
Predict contact rate for each setting. Note that this function is
parallelisable with \code{future}, and will be impacted by any \code{future} plans
provided.
}
\details{
We use Per-capita household size instead of mean household size.
Per-capita household size is different to mean household size, as the
household size averaged over \strong{people} in the population, not over
households, so larger households get upweighted. It is calculated by
taking a distribution of the number of households of each size in a
population, multiplying the size by the household by the household count
to get the number of people with that size of household, and computing
the population-weighted average of household sizes. We use per-capita
household size as it is a more accurate reflection of the average
number of household members a person in the population can have contact
with.
