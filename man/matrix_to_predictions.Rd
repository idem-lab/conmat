\title{Convert a contact matrix as output into a long-form tibble}
\usage{
matrix_to_predictions(contact_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{contact_matrix}{square matrix with age group to and from information
in the row and column names.}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns \code{age_group_to}, \code{age_group_from}, and
\code{contacts}.
}
\description{
This function is the opposite of \code{\link[=predictions_to_matrix]{predictions_to_matrix()}}. It
converts a wide matrix into a long data frame. It is mostly used within
plotting functions.
}
\examples{
fairfield <- abs_age_lga("Fairfield (C)")

# We can convert the predictions into a matrix

fairfield_school_contacts <- predict_contacts(
  model = polymod_setting_models$school,
  population = fairfield,
  age_breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, Inf)
)

fairfield_school_contacts

fairfield_school_mat <- predictions_to_matrix(fairfield_school_contacts)

fairfield_school_mat

matrix_to_predictions(fairfield_school_mat)
