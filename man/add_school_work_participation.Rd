\title{Add columns describing the fractions of the population in each age group
that attend school/work (average FTE)}
\usage{
add_school_work_participation(
  contact_data,
  school_demographics = NULL,
  work_demographics = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{contact_data}{contact data containing columns: \code{age_to}, \code{age_from},
and \code{pop_age_to} (from \code{\link[=add_population_age_to]{add_population_age_to()}})}

\item{school_demographics}{(optional) defaults to census average proportion
at school. You can provide a dataset with columns, "age" (numeric), and
"school_fraction" (0-1), if you would like to specify these
details. See \code{abs_avg_school} for the default values. If you would like to
use the original school demographics used in conmat, these are provided in
the dataset, \code{conmat_original_school_demographics}.}

\item{work_demographics}{(optional) defaults to census average proportion
employed. You can provide a dataset with columns, "age" (numeric), and
"work_fraction", if you would like to specify these details. See
\code{abs_avg_work} for the default values. If you would like to
use the original work demographics used in conmat, these are provided in
the dataset, \code{conmat_original_work_demographics}.}

\value{
dataset with 9 extra columns: school_fraction_age_from,
work_fraction_age_from, school_fraction_age_to, work_fraction_age_to,
school_probability, work_probability, school_year_probability, and
school_weighted_pop_fraction.
}
\description{
Add fractions of the population in each age group that attend school/work
(average FTE) to compute the probability that both participant and
contact attend school/work. Requires columns \code{age_to} and  \code{age_from}.
Note that it will operate on any column starting with \code{age}. Adds columns:
\code{school_probability}, \code{work_probability}, \code{school_year_probability}, and
\code{school_weighted_pop_fraction}. The columns \code{school_probability} and
\code{work_probability} represent the probability a person of the other age
goes to the same work/school. \code{school_year_probability} represents the
probability that a person of the other age would be in the same school
year. \code{school_weighted_pop_fraction} represents the weighted combination
of contact population age distribution & school year probability, so that
if the contact is in the same school year, the weight is 1, and otherwise
it is the population age fraction. This can be used as an offset, so that
population age distribution can be used outside the classroom, but does
not affect classroom contacts (which due to cohorting and regularised
class sizes are unlikely to depend on the population age distribution).
}
\note{
To use previous approach input the arguments \code{school_demographics} and
\code{work_demographics} with \code{conmat_original_school_demographics} and \code{conmat_original_work_demographics}, respectively.
