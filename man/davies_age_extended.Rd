\title{Susceptibility and clinical fraction parameters from Davies et al.}
\format{
A data frame of the probability of transmission from a case to a contact. There are 101 rows and 4 variables.
\describe{
\item{age}{from 0 to 100}
\item{clinical_fraction}{Estimate of fraction with clinical symptoms, or the age-specific proportion of infections resulting in clinical symptoms inferred by applying a smoothing spline to the mean estimates from Davies et al. }
\item{davies_original}{Age specific parameters of the relative susceptibility to
infection inferred from a smoothing-spline estimate of the mean relative susceptibility estimate from Davies et al.}
\item{davies_updated}{Re-estimated parameter of the susceptibility profile for under-16s that is estimated in a similar way but to the age-distribution of infections in England from the UK ONS prevalence survey rather than case counts which may undercount children}
