\title{Predict contact rate between two age populations, given some model.}
\usage{
predict_contacts(model, population, age_breaks = c(seq(0, 75, by = 5), Inf))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A single fitted model of contact rate (e.g.,
\code{\link[=fit_single_contact_model]{fit_single_contact_model()}})}

\item{population}{a dataframe of age population information, with columns
indicating some lower age limit, and population, (e.g., \code{\link[=get_polymod_population]{get_polymod_population()}})}

\item{age_breaks}{the ages to predict to. By default, the age breaks are
0-75 in 5 year groups.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with three columns: \code{age_group_from}, \code{age_group_to},
and  \code{contacts}. The age groups are factors, broken up into 5 year bins
\verb{[0,5)}, \verb{[5,10)}. The \code{contact} column is the predicted number of
contacts from the specified age group to the other one.
}
\description{
Predicts the expected contact rate over specified age breaks,
given some model of contact rate and population age structure.
This function is used internally in \code{\link[=predict_setting_contacts]{predict_setting_contacts()}}, which
performs this prediction across all settings (home, work, school, other),
and optionally performs an adjustment for per capita household size. You
can use \code{predict_contacts()} by itself, just be aware you will need to
separately apply a per capita household size adjustment if required. See
details below on \code{adjust_household_contact_matrix} for more information.
}
\details{
The population data is used to determine age range to predict
contact rates, and removes ages with zero population, so we do not
make predictions for ages with zero populations. Contact rates are
predicted yearly between the age groups, using \code{\link[=predict_contacts_1y]{predict_contacts_1y()}},
then aggregates these predicted contacts using
\code{\link[=aggregate_predicted_contacts]{aggregate_predicted_contacts()}}, which aggregates the predictions back to
the same resolution as the data, appropriately weighting the contact rate
by the population.

Regarding the \code{adjust_household_contact_matrix} function, we use
Per-capita household size instead of mean household size.
Per-capita household size is different to mean household size, as the
household size averaged over people in the \strong{population}, not over
households, so larger households get upweighted. It is calculated by
taking a distribution of the number of households of each size in a
population, multiplying the size by the household by the household count
to get the number of people with that size of household, and computing
the population-weighted average of household sizes. We use per-capita
household size as it is a more accurate reflection of the average
number of household members a person in the population can have contact
with.

\examples{
# If we have a model of contact rate at home, and age population structure
# for an LGA, say, Fairfield, in NSW:

polymod_setting_models$home

fairfield <- abs_age_lga("Fairfield (C)")

fairfield

# We can predict the contact rate for Fairfield from the existing contact
# data, say, between the age groups of 0-15 in 5 year bins for school:

fairfield_school_contacts <- predict_contacts(
  model = polymod_setting_models$school,
  population = fairfield,
  age_breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, Inf)
)

fairfield_school_contacts
