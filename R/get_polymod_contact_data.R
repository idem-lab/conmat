#' @title Format POLYMOD data and filter contacts to certain settings
#'
#' @description Provides contact and participant POLYMOD data from selected
#'   countries. It impute missing contact ages via one of three methods:
#'   1) imputing contact ages from a random uniform distribution from the range
#'   of ages. 2) using the average of the ages, 3) removal of those
#'   participants. The contact  settings are then classified as "home",
#'   "school", "work" and "others", where "others" include locations such as
#'   leisure, transport or other places. The participants with missing contact
#'   ages or settings are removed, and the number of contacts per participant
#'   and contact age from ages 0-100 are obtained for various countries and
#'   settings.
#'
#' @param setting Which setting to extract data from. Default is all settings.
#'    Options are: "all", "home", "work", "school", and "other".
#' @param countries countries to extract data from. Default is all countries
#'   from this list: "Belgium", "Finland", "Germany", "Italy", "Luxembourg",
#'   "Netherlands", "Poland", and "United Kingdom".
#' @param ages Which ages to return. Default is ages 0 to 100.
#' @param contact_age_imputation How to handle age when it is missing. Choose
#'   one of three methods: 1) "sample", which imputes contact ages from a
#'   random uniform distribution from the range of ages. 2) "mean", use the
#'   average of the ages, 3) "remove_participant" removal of those
#'   participants. Default is "sample".
#' @return A data.frame with columns: "setting" (all, work, home, etc. as
#'   specified in "setting" argument); "age_from" - the age of the participant;
#'   "age_to" - the age of the person the participant had contact with;
#'   "contacts" the number of contacts that person had; "participants" the
#'   number of participants in that row.
