#' @title Add symmetrical, age based features
#' @description This function adds 6 columns to assist with describing
#'   various age based interactions for model fitting. Requires that the
#'   age columns are called "age_from", and "age_to"
#'
#' @param data data.frame with columns, `age_from`, and `age_to`
#' @return data.frame with 6 more columns, `gam_age_offdiag`, `gam_age_offdiag_2`, `gam_age_diag_prod`, `gam_age_diag_sum`, `gam_age_pmax`, `gam_age_pmin`,
#' @examples

#'   age_from = vec_age,
#'   age_to = vec_age
