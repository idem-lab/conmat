#' @title Adds offset variables
#'
#' @description Mostly used internally in `add_modelling_features()`. Adds two
#'   offset variables to be used in [fit_single_contact_model()]:
#'   1) `log_contactable_population_school`, and
#'   2) `log_contactable_population`.
#'   These two variables require variables `school_weighted_pop_fraction` (from
#'     [add_school_work_participation()]) and `pop_age_to` (from
#'     [add_school_work_participation()]). This provides separate offsets
#'     for school setting when compared to the other settings such as home,
#'     work and other. The offset for school captures cohorting of students
#'     for schools and takes the logarithm of the weighted combination of
#'     contact population age distribution & school year probability calculated
#'     in [add_school_work_participation()]. See "details" for more information.
#'
#' @details why double offsets? There are two offsets specified, once in the
#'   model formula, and once in the "offset" argument of `mgcv::bam`. The
#'   offsets get added together when the model first fit. In addition, the
#'   setting specific offset from  `offset_variable`, which is included in the
#'   GAM model as `... + offset(log_contactable_population)` is used in
#'   prediction, whereas the other offset, included as an argument in the GAM
#'   as `offset = log(participants)` is only included when the model is
#'   initially created. See more detail in [fit_single_contact_model()].
#'
#' @return data.frame of `contact_data` with two extra columns:
#'   `log_contactable_population_school` and `log_contactable_population`
#' @param contact_data contact data - must contain columns `age_to`, `age_from`,
#'   `pop_age_to` (from [add_population_age_to()], and
#'   `school_weighted_pop_fraction` (from [add_school_work_participation()])).
