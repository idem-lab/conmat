#' Get Setting Transmission Matrices
#'
#' Given some age breaks, return a named list of matrices containing
#' age-specific relative per-contact transmission probability matrices for each
#' of 4 settings: home, school, work, other. These can be combined with contact
#' matrices to produce setting-specific relative next generation matrices
#' (NGMs). These can be scaled to match a required reproduction number based on
#' the dominant eigenvalue of the all-settings NGM (the elementwise sum of all
#' setting NGMs).
#'
#' These matrices are created from: an estimate of the clinical fraction for
#' each age (inferred by applying a smoothing spline to the mean estimates from
#' Davies et al.); an assumption of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative
#' to symptomatics (provided as an argument); estimates of the relative
#' susceptibility to infection of individuals of different ages, inferred from a
#' smoothing-spline estimate of the mean relative susceptibility estimate from
#' Davies et al., combined with a re-estimation of the susceptibility profile
#' for under-16s, estimated in a similar way but to the age-distribution of
#' infections in England from the UK ONS prevalence survey (rather than case
#' counts with may undercount children), assuming the above clinical fraction
#' estimates, and accounting for vaccination, reduced mixing, and reduced
#' transmissibility in work and other settings due to hygiene behaviour; and
#' estimates of the relative transmissibility in household vs non-household
#' settings - scaled linearly for non-household transmission and binomially for
#' household transmission (so that onward infections do not to exceed the number
#' of other household members).
#'
#' When using this data, ensure that you cite this package, and the original
#' authors of the paper from which these estimates were derived:

#' Davies, N.G., Klepac, P., Liu, Y. et al. Age-dependent effects in the
#' transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics. Nat Med 26, 1205â€“1211 (2020).

#'
#' @param age_breaks vector of age breaks, defaults to
#'   `c(seq(0, 80, by = 5), Inf)`
#' @param asymptomatic_relative_infectiousness the assumed ratio of onward
#'   infectiousness between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. This represents
#'   the infectiousness of asymptomatic relative to symptomatic.
#'   Default value is 0.5, which means the asymptomatic cases are 50% less
#'   infectious than symptomatic cases.
#' @param susceptibility_estimate Which estimate to use for susceptibility by
#'   age. Either, the smoothed original Davies et al estimates,
#'   "davies_original" or, the set updated to match UK under-16 infections
#'    (the default), "davies_updated".
