#' @title Fit a single GAM contact model to a dataset
#' 
#' @description This is the workhorse of the `conmat` package, and is typically
#'   used inside [fit_setting_contacts()]. It predicts the contact rate between 
#'   all age bands (the contact rate between ages 0 and 1, 0 and 2, 0 and 3, 
#'   and so on), for a specified setting, with specific terms being added for 
#'   given settings. See "details" for further information.
#'   
#' @details The model fit is a Generalised Additive Model (GAM). To help 
#'   account for assortativity with age, where people of similar ages have 
#'   more contact with each other, we include predictors `age_from`, and 
#'   `age_to`. To account for intergenerational contact patterns, where 
#'   parents and grandparents will interact with their children and grand 
#'   children, we include a term that is the absolute difference of age_from 
#'   and age_to. We also include the interaction of intergenerational contact 
#'   patterns with contacts from one age with the term that is the absolute 
#'   difference of age_from and age_to, and age_from. These terms are fit with 
#'   a smoothing function. Specifically, the relevant code looks like this:
#'   
#'   ``` r
#'   s(age_to) + 
#'     s(age_from) + 
#'     s(abs(age_from - age_to)) + 
#'     s(abs(age_from - age_to), age_from)
#'   ```
#'   
#'   We also include predictors for the probability of attending school, and 
#'   attending work. These are computed as the probability that a person goes 
#'   to the same school/work, proportional to the increase in contacts due to
#'   attendance. These terms are calculated from estimated proportion of 
#'   people in age groups attending school and work. See 
#'   [add_modelling_features()] for more details.
#'   
#'   Finally, we include two offset terms so that we estimate the contact rate, 
#'   that is the contacts per capita, instead of the number of contacts. These
#'   offset terms are `log(contactable_population)`, and 
#'   `log(contactable_population_school)` when the model is fit to a school 
#'   setting. The contactable population is estimated as the interpolated 
#'   1 year ages from the data. For schools this is the contactable population
#'   weighted by the proportion of the population attending school.
#'   
#'   This leaves us with a model that looks like so:
#'   
#'   ``` r
#'   mgcv::bam(
#'     formula = contacts ~
#'       s(age_to) +
#'       s(age_from) +
#'       s(abs(age_from - age_to)) +
#'       s(abs(age_from - age_to), age_from) +
#'       school_probability +
#'       work_probability + 
#'       offset(log_contactable_population) +
#'       # or for school settings
#'       # offset(log_contactable_population_school) 
#'       family = stats::poisson,
#'     offset = log(participants),
#'     data = population_data
#'   )
#'   ```
#' @param contact_data dataset with columns `age_to`, `age_from`, `setting`,
#'  `contacts`, and `participants`. See [get_polymod_contact_data()] for
#'   an example dataset - or the dataset in examples below.
