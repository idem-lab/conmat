#' @title Adjust Household Contact Matrix
#'
#' @description This function is used internally within
#'   [predict_setting_contacts()]. See details below for why we use the per
#'   capita adjustment
#'
#' @details We use Per-capita household size instead of mean household size.
#'     Per-capita household size is different to mean household size, as the
#'     household size averaged over people in the **population**, not over
#'     households, so larger households get upweighted. It is calculated by
#'     taking a distribution of the number of households of each size in a
#'     population, multiplying the size by the household by the household count
#'     to get the number of people with that size of household, and computing
#'     the population-weighted average of household sizes. We use per-capita
#'     household size as it is a more accurate reflection of the average
#'     number of household members a person in the population can have contact
#'     with.
